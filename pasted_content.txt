- Sketch key user flows (e.g., receiving stock, creating sales orders) to guide UI wireframes.  
- Choose an ORM (Knex, Sequelize) and decide on server-framework patterns (MVC, services).

- Consider mobile-app support or PWA for on-the-go order entry and stock checks.  
- Evaluate predictive analytics or simple machine-learning models for demand forecasting.

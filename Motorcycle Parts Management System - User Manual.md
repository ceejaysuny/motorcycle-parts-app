## 3. Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is the central hub of the Motorcycle Parts Management System, providing a real-time, at-a-glance overview of your business's key performance indicators (KPIs). It is designed to offer immediate insights into sales, inventory, and operational health, enabling quick decision-making and proactive management. Upon logging in, you will typically land on this page.

### 3.1. Understanding Dashboard Widgets

The dashboard is composed of various customizable widgets, each displaying specific data points or charts. Common widgets include:

*   **Sales Performance:** Displays total sales revenue, sales trends over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), and top-selling products or categories. This widget often includes interactive charts (e.g., line graphs, bar charts) that allow you to visualize sales data.
*   **Inventory Status:** Shows current stock levels, highlighting low-stock items, out-of-stock products, and inventory valuation. This helps in identifying items that need immediate attention for reordering.
*   **Order Status:** Provides a summary of pending orders, orders in fulfillment, completed orders, and any overdue orders. This gives a quick overview of your order pipeline.
*   **Financial Summary:** Presents key financial figures such as total outstanding invoices, accounts receivable aging, and recent payment activities. This helps in monitoring cash flow and financial health.
*   **Customer Activity:** Displays new customer registrations, top customers by sales volume, and recent customer interactions. This helps in understanding customer engagement.
*   **Supplier Performance:** Shows metrics related to supplier delivery times, order accuracy, and overall performance. This aids in evaluating supplier reliability.

### 3.2. Customizing Your Dashboard

Many dashboards offer customization options, allowing you to arrange widgets, select which data to display, and set preferred timeframes for reports. This personalization ensures that the most relevant information for your role is always at your fingertips.

1.  **Access Customization Mode:** Look for an "Edit Dashboard," "Customize," or a gear icon on the dashboard page. Clicking this will usually put the dashboard into an editable mode.

### 3.3. Interpreting Dashboard Data

Effective use of the dashboard involves understanding what the data means and how it relates to your business operations:

*   **Trends:** Look for patterns in charts and graphs. Are sales increasing or decreasing? Is inventory turnover improving?
*   **Alerts:** Pay attention to any red flags or warnings, such as low stock alerts or overdue payments. These indicate areas requiring immediate action.
*   **Comparisons:** Compare current performance against previous periods (e.g., last month, last quarter) or against set targets to gauge progress.
*   **Drill-Down:** Many widgets allow you to click on a data point or a summary to view more detailed information. For example, clicking on a "Low Stock" alert might take you directly to the inventory page filtered for those items.

The dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring the pulse of your business. Regular review and understanding of its insights will significantly aid in operational management and strategic planning.

## 4. Product Management

The Product Management module is the central repository for all information related to the motorcycle parts you trade.

    *   To manage categories, look for a "Categories" or "Product Types" section within the Product Management module or in system settings.
    *   You can add new categories, edit existing ones, and assign products to them.
*   **Attributes:** These are specific characteristics of a product (e.g., "Color," "Size," "Material," "Chain Pitch"). Attributes can be defined globally and then assigned values for individual products. This ensures consistency and facilitates detailed product searches.
    *   Attribute management is usually found alongside category management. You can define attribute names and their possible values.

### 4.4. Product Compatibility Management

One of the most critical features for a motorcycle parts trader is managing product compatibility. This ensures that customers purchase the correct parts for their specific motorcycle models.

*   **Linking Compatibility:** Within the product detail page, there will be a section dedicated to compatibility. Here, you can link the product to specific motorcycle makes (e.g., Honda, Yamaha), models (e.g., CBR600RR, YZF-R1), and years (e.g., 2005-2010).
*   **Batch Updates:** For products compatible with many models, the system may offer batch update features or import functionalities to quickly assign compatibility.
*   **Search by Compatibility:** Customers and internal staff should be able to search for parts by entering their motorcycle's make, model, and year, which will then filter the product catalog to show only compatible items.

## 5. Inventory Management

The Inventory Management module provides real-time visibility and control over your stock levels across all warehouses.

### 5.4. Low Stock Alerts and Reorder Suggestions

The system automates the process of identifying low stock and suggesting reorders to prevent stockouts and ensure continuous availability of popular parts.

*   **Setting Thresholds:** For each product, you can define a "Minimum Stock Level." When the quantity of a product falls below this level, the system will trigger a low stock alert.
*   **Receiving Alerts:** Alerts can be configured to appear on the dashboard, as in-app notifications, or via email. Regularly check your dashboard and notification center for these alerts.
*   **Reorder Quantity:** You can also set a "Reorder Quantity" for each product, which is the recommended amount to order when stock is low. This can be based on historical sales data or supplier lead times.
*   **Generating Reorder Suggestions:** The system will compile a list of products that need reordering based on their current stock levels and defined thresholds. This list can often be used to directly generate purchase orders.

### 5.5. Inventory Valuation

The system supports different inventory valuation methods to accurately reflect the cost of goods sold and the value of your remaining inventory. Common methods include:

*   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** Assumes that the first units purchased are the first ones sold. This method generally results in a higher reported profit during periods of rising costs.
*   **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** Assumes that the last units purchased are the first ones sold. This method generally results in a lower reported profit during periods of rising costs.
*   **Weighted Average Cost:** Calculates the average cost of all units available for sale and uses that average to determine the cost of goods sold and ending inventory.

Your system administrator will typically configure the preferred valuation method. The system will automatically apply this method when calculating inventory values and cost of goods sold for financial reports.

## 6. Supplier Management

The Supplier Management module allows you to maintain a comprehensive database of all your vendors, track their performance, and streamline your procurement processes.
